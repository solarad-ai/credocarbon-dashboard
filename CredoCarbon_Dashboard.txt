🎯 SECTION 1 DONE

Homepage ✅ SECTION 2 — HOMEPAGE (Developer & Buyer Entry Point) URL: /
Purpose: Provide a unified, professional landing page that routes the
two publicly accessible user roles — Developer and Buyer — to their
respective login/signup flows. VVB and Registry users are not visible
here; they access the platform exclusively via admin-generated URLs.

  ------------------------------------------------------------
  2.0 PAGE OBJECTIVE
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  The homepage should: Represent CredoCarbon as a credible
  carbon management ecosystem.

  Provide two clear action paths:

  Developer Workflow

  Buyer Workflow

  Keep the UI uncluttered, minimal, and authoritative.

  Establish trust (ESG-grade design tone).

  Hide VVB and Registry from public view.

  Maintain clean routing to login/signup pages.

  This page is non-functional beyond routing; no dashboards or
  data here.

  Developer Login & Signup ✅ SECTION 2 — DEVELOPER LOGIN &
  SIGNUP URLs: Login: /developer/login

  Signup: /developer/signup

  Purpose: Authenticate project developers into the
  CredoCarbon platform so they can create/manage projects,
  upload documents, interact with VVBs, go through
  validation/issuance, and manage sell orders. This is only
  for Developers — not Buyers, VVBs, or Registries.

  2.0 SCOPE & ACTORS Actors: Developer (Primary)

  Companies or individuals acting as project developers / IPPs
  / asset owners.

  Platform Security (Backend services)

  Auth service, rate limiter, session manager.

  Out of scope here: VVB login

  Registry login

  Buyer login (covered later in Buyer sections)

  2.1 URLS & ROUTING /developer/login → Developer login screen

  /developer/signup → Developer signup screen

  /developer/forgot-password → Password reset request

  /developer/reset-password?token=XYZ → Reset form

  After successful login → redirect to: GET
  /developer/dashboard (Section 6)

  If a logged-in developer tries to go to /developer/login or
  /developer/signup, redirect to /developer/dashboard.

  2.2 DEVELOPER LOGIN PAGE (/developer/login) 2.2.1 Layout
  Split layout (desktop): Left side: Brand panel

  Right side: Login form

  On mobile, brand info collapses and form becomes full-width.

  2.2.2 Brand Panel (Left) Content: CredoCarbon logo

  Heading: “Developer Portal”

  Short blurb:

  “Register and manage carbon projects across all major
  registries from a single unified interface.”

  Optional: 1–2 small bullet points: End-to-end workflow: PDD
  → Validation → Issuance → Market

  Supports Solar, Wind, A/R, REDD+, Biochar, DAC, etc.

  2.2.3 Login Form (Right) Fields: Controls: Checkbox:
  Remember me (optional)

  Primary button: Log In

  Link: Forgot password? → /developer/forgot-password

  Link: New developer? Create an account → /developer/signup

  Validation: Email format check

  Password non-empty

  On invalid credentials:

  Show: “Incorrect email or password.”

  Do not reveal whether email exists.

  Security: Throttle repeated login attempts (rate limiting)

  Optionally enable CAPTCHA after N failed attempts

  Only accept over HTTPS

  2.3 DEVELOPER SIGNUP PAGE (/developer/signup) Signup is for
  new developer organizations (or individual developers) only.
  You can implement it as either: A separate route
  /developer/signup, or

  A tab on the same page with /developer/login?tab=signup

  For clarity, treat it as a dedicated page.

  2.3.1 Signup Flow Overview Signup is a single page with:
  Basic user details

  Organization details

  Terms acceptance

  Account creation & redirect

  KYC comes later in Profile (Section 20+), not here.

  2.3.2 Fields A. User Details B. Organization Details C.
  Legal / Consent Checkbox: “I agree to the Terms of Service
  and Privacy Policy.” (must be checked)

  (Optional) Checkbox: “I want to receive product updates and
  notifications.”

  2.3.3 Buttons & Behavior Primary: Create Developer Account

  On success:

  Option 1 (recommended initial): Auto-login and redirect to
  /developer/dashboard

  Option 2: Require email verification first (see 2.4)

  You can start with auto-login and plan email verification in
  later version.

  2.4 OPTIONAL EMAIL VERIFICATION (RECOMMENDED, BUT CAN BE
  PHASED) If enabled: After signup:

  Send verification email with link
  /developer/verify-email?token=XYZ

  Show page: “Please verify your email to continue.”

  Until verified:

  Block project creation

  Show banner on dashboard: “Your email is not verified.”

  You can keep this in backlog if you want to move fast
  initially.

  2.5 FORGOT PASSWORD (/developer/forgot-password) Fields:
  Email (required)

  Flow: Developer enters email.

  System if account exists sends password reset link:
  /developer/reset-password?token=XYZ

  Show non-leaky message:

  “If this email is registered, a reset link has been sent.”

  Reset form: Fields: New password, Confirm password

  Validate token + expiry

  On success: redirect to /developer/login with toast:

  “Password updated. You can now log in.”

  2.6 AUTH & BACKEND LOGIC (DEVELOPER ROLE) 2.6.1 Role &
  Permissions This flow creates users with role = DEVELOPER.

  All /developer/* routes must enforce:

  Valid JWT (or session)

  role == DEVELOPER

  No Buyer, VVB, Registry user can access developer routes.
  2.6.2 Data Model (Minimal) Example: { “id”: “DEV-123”,
  “name”: “Jane Doe”, “email”: “jane@solar-dev.com”, “role”:
  “DEVELOPER”, “company_name”: “Solar Dev Pvt Ltd”, “country”:
  “India”, “created_at”: “…”, “email_verified”: false }

  2.7 API CONTRACTS Login POST /api/developer/login Request: {
  “email”: “user@company.com”, “password”: “******” }

  Response: { “access_token”: “”, “token_type”: “bearer”,
  “developer_id”: “DEV-123”, “name”: “Jane Doe”, “company”:
  “Solar Dev Pvt Ltd” }

  Signup POST /api/developer/signup Request: { “name”: “Jane
  Doe”, “email”: “user@company.com”, “password”: “******”,
  “company_name”: “Solar Dev Pvt Ltd”, “country”: “India”,
  “developer_type”: “IPP” }

  Response: { “developer_id”: “DEV-123”, “access_token”: “” }

  Forgot Password POST /api/developer/forgot-password Request:
  { “email”: “user@company.com” }

  Response: { “message”: “If this email is registered, a reset
  link has been sent.” }

  Reset Password POST /api/developer/reset-password Request: {
  “token”: “”, “password”: “new_password” }

  Response: { “message”: “Password reset successful.” }

  2.8 ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA Section 2 is done when: Developer
  can sign up and log in successfully.

  Wrong credentials produce a safe error message.

  Developer login/session gates all /developer/* routes.

  Forgot password flow works end-to-end.

  No Buyer/VVB/Registry accounts can log into /developer/*.

  UI is consistent with homepage brand.

  Page is responsive.

  Authentication Helper ✅ SECTION 4 — PASSWORD RESET, EMAIL
  VERIFICATION & MULTI-ROLE ACCESS SUPPORT URL Group:
  /developer/forgot-password

  /buyer/forgot-password

  /developer/reset-password

  /buyer/reset-password

  /verify-email

  Purpose: Provide secure, registry-grade authentication
  support for both Developers and Buyers.
  ------------------------------------------------------------

4.0 PURPOSE OF THIS MODULE

The authentication helper module provides: Password reset flow for
Developers & Buyers

Email verification (optional but recommended)

Secure token-based process

Prevents unauthorized access

Prepares platform for multi-role workflows

This is a shared module across Developer & Buyer portals.

  ------------------------------------------------------------
  4.1 PASSWORD RESET FLOW
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  Step 1 — Request Reset Route: /developer/forgot-password
  /buyer/forgot-password Fields: Email (required)

  Behavior: Always respond:

  “If this email is registered, we have sent password reset
  instructions.”

  Never reveal whether email exists.

  Backend: Generate token (expiry: 30 mins)

  Email user a reset link: /reset-password?token=

  Step 2 — Reset Form Route:
  /developer/reset-password?token=XYZ
  /buyer/reset-password?token=XYZ Fields: New Password

  Confirm Password

  Validation: Token valid + not expired

  Strong password rules

  Both must match

  Step 3 — Completion On success: Invalidate token

  Redirect to login

  Show toast:

  “Password updated. You can now log in.”
  ------------------------------------------------------------

4.2 EMAIL VERIFICATION (Optional Feature)

When enabled: Flow: After signup, user receives email:
/verify-email?token=

Until verification, show banner in Dashboard:

“Please verify your email to access all features.”

Verification unlocks all functionality.

  ------------------------------------------------------------
  4.3 MULTI-ROLE ACCESS LOGIC
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  The same browser may hold: Developer session

  Buyer session

  But users cannot cross over. Rules: Developer role → Can
  only access /developer/* routes

  Buyer role → Can only access /buyer/* routes

  If Developer tries /buyer/*, redirect to /buyer/login

  If Buyer tries /developer/*, redirect to /developer/login

  This enforces strict separation.
  ------------------------------------------------------------

4.4 SHARED API CONTRACTS

POST /api/auth/forgot-password { “email”: “user@example.com” }

POST /api/auth/reset-password { “token”: “”, “password”: “NewPass123” }

GET /api/auth/verify-email?token=XYZ

  ------------------------------------------------------------
  4.5 ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  This module is complete when: Both Developer & Buyer can
  reset passwords

  Token-based flow secured

  Errors handled safely

  Optional email verification works

  Route separation enforced

  Developer Dashboard ✅ SECTION 5 — PLATFORM DASHBOARD
  ARCHITECTURE (Developer & Buyer Shared Logic) Purpose:
  Define the shared structural philosophy for dashboards
  across Developer and Buyer roles, ensuring consistent UX,
  predictable navigation, and a unified design system. This
  section is NOT a dashboard itself — it is the blueprint that
  both Developer Dashboard (Section 6) and Buyer Dashboard
  (Section 28) follow.
  ------------------------------------------------------------

5.0 OBJECTIVE

A single, consistent dashboard architecture allows: Fast development

Shared components

Reduced UX complexity

Predictable navigation

Easy scaling when adding new modules

Clear role-based separation

Both Developer and Buyer dashboards follow the same three-panel
structure: Left Panel → Navigation (modules) Top Bar → Notifications,
Profile, Search Main Workspace → Page content

  ------------------------------------------------------------
  5.1 DASHBOARD LAYOUT (COMMON TEMPLATE)
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  A. Left Navigation Panel Stays fixed

  Contains top-level modules

  Bottom section contains utility items

  Two zones: Top Modules (Role-Specific)

  Developer: Project Setup, Project Lifecycle, Market Ops

  Buyer: Marketplace, Offers, Wallet, Retirements

  Bottom Items (Universal)

  Notifications

  Profile & KYC

  Logout

  Spacing and separators distinguish between “functional
  modules” and “utility items.”

  B. Top Bar (Shared Across All Roles) Contains: Platform logo
  (click → dashboard home)

  Search bar (optional for future)

  Notifications icon (badge counter)

  Profile icon (click → Profile & KYC)

  C. Main Workspace (Dynamic Content Zone) All sections from 6
  → 17 (Developer) and 28 → 33 (Buyer) load here. Principles:
  No scrolling inside left panel

  Full vertical scrolling in workspace

  Breadcrumbs at top of workspace

  All actions placed top-right (e.g., Add Project, Upload
  Data)
  ------------------------------------------------------------

5.2 ROLE-BASED VISIBILITY

Developer sees: Project Setup Project Lifecycle Market Operations
Notifications Profile & KYC Logout

Buyer sees: Marketplace Offers & Negotiations Wallet Retirements
Notifications Profile & KYC Logout

NOT visible to Developer or Buyer: VVB dashboard

Registry dashboard

Admin tools

These are separate, secure portals.

  ------------------------------------------------------------
  5.3 RESPONSIVE DESIGN RULES
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  Below 1024px: Left nav collapses into an icon-only bar

  Below 768px: Left nav collapses into hamburger

  Workspace becomes full width
